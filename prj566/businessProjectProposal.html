Brief Description of system you are proposing. Please include your research reference (contacts, etc ): </b></br>
The group will create a web-based system to align Seneca PRJ566 student teams to potential external sponsors. It will act a portal for current semester PRJ566 teams as well as an archive for past teams and projects.  It will enable students to give descriptions about themselves and their team for interested sponsors. Interested sponsors can glean information about the PRJ 566/666  program, acquaint themselves with various teams, past projects and can, if they are interested,  sign up to participate. To do so they must and provide information about their company and a project for which they would like to work with Seneca and the PRJ566/666 program. By registering, companies are aware of legal conditions and so Seneca can pre-qualify projects. Moreover, the Sponsors will be aware of their project status through their web page throughout the lifecycle. Teams and Sponsors will be able to rank each other based on their interest level and will be matched based on their preferences in amore formal way. </br>
 </br>
System proposed design is based on the requirements gathered during the meeting with Mark Buchner. </br>
</br>
<b>
Please explain why you feel there is a need or market for this system: </b></br>
The system streamlines administration of the PRJ566 projects giving students more time to focus on high quality design instead of sales, legal and administrative processes. Currently the process for external sponsors to be connected with a PRJ566 team can be very slow and results in teams deferring the ability to provide a quality design until late in the semester. Sponsors are unable to present themselves and their project ahead of time to students and sponsors are unable to know anything about the potential PRJ566 team ahead of time either. Part of the delay in the process is often the correct understanding and acceptance of the legal contract. This system would present the legal agreement at start of the process, allowing Sponsors and Seneca to clear any concerns quickly. Sponsor interest in PRJ566 occurs randomly throughout the year whereas the matching process occurs 3X annually in very specific windows. The system will also help manage possible projects and sponsors so that they do not get “lost”. Currently Sponsors have no way to check the status of their project, therefore there needs to be a way for consistent status updates to be conveyed. </br>
</br>
<b>
Please describe the system in more detail. Choose the functions that you feel are most important and describe how they will work. Give each function a title and briefly explain it's responsibility in a few sentences: </b></br>
</br>
The system will have a Home Page where the description of the PRJ566 course will be displayed, and a current projects and past projects can be viewed. Selected projects may be “showcased including customer comments. From the Home Page a potential Sponsor can register a sponsor company. When an account is created by the administrator, can login to the Company Page. Also, from the Home Page, each team leader can login to their Team Page with credentials provided by site administrator. Moreover, the appointed site administrator (the professor who teaches the PRJ566 in the current semester) can login to the administration console to manage some site functionalities. </br>
</br>
The proposed system will have the following major functions: <br/>
</br>
<u>
Sponsor Registration </u></br>
This function allows a company to be pre-qualified as a Sponsor for a PRJ566 project and if approved by the administrator, the company's page is created where the company contact person can view and rank the teams. The legal agreement is accepted at the first step of the registration, to make a potential Sponsor aware of any legal issues before he/she can start the registration process itself. A select number of mandatory fields must be filled in. The site administrator makes the final decision whether or not the particular project is suitable for PRJ566 needs. The sponsor has the ability to indicate certain project constraints such as timing(e.g. must be implemented by date), hardware (e.g. implemented on IBM iSeries), software (e.g. PHP), and architectural/other (e.g. transactional DB). When a project is complete, the sponsor has the opportunity to provide comments, which could be used by Seneca for publicity purposes and showcasing of prj projects. Password management functionality (reset password, forgot password etc) will be integrated. </br>
</br>
<u>
Team Page Creation </u></br>
This function allows a team leader to create the team page based on a template, after the administrator has created the account. The first time a team leader logs in the Create a Team Page appears allowing to upload any necessary pictures (e.g. team logo, team member’s pictures) and give short text descriptions (e.g. team description, team member short story). Spell check is integrated. When everything is uploaded and text is entered, the team leader publishes the page. From now on, when team leader logs in the Team Page appears skipping the creation step. From here all the offered projects can be viewed and ranked. The team page can be use to highlight certain constraints, such as timing (e.g. not available term 2), technology (e.g. limited to Apple), products (e.g .no Java), type (e.g. Game). </br>
</br>
<u>
Project/Team Ranking </u></br>
This function allows Sponsors to rank teams for their project and Teams to rank projects according to their interests. Options such as “no preference” or “exclude” would be available. A clever ranking and matching User Interface will be determined. </br>
</br>
<u>
Project-Team Matching </u></br>
This function is triggered by the site administrator. Moreover, it automates the matching process based on the rankings from the Teams and Sponsors. The result table can be edited by the appointed site administrator. The function is integrated with an email system to automatically alert all affected parties. </br>
</br>
<u>
Calendar and Schedule </u></br>
This function allows the Sponsor to view the common PRJ566 project life cycle, allowing them to monitor the process. The PRJ  team will have the ability to identify project milestones and keep manage the status. Also, the start and end dates for upcoming PRJ566 semesters are displayed, allowing Sponsors to plan their future projects’ timeline. A clever, easy-to-use UI will be designed. </br>
</br>
<u>
Administration Controls </u></br>
This function allows the appointed administrator to approve company projects, create company account and company page (is generated automatically from a template upon account creation), create team accounts, finalize project-team matching process and change the status of a project. </br>
</br>
<b>
Please walk through a typical usage of your system (a scenario). For example, selecting and selling an item; creating an appointment, setting up a sports team: </b></br>
</br>
<u>
Registering a Project </u></br>
</br>
Scenario 1: Sponsor is already registered. </br>
</br>
The company representative logs in and the company page appears. The user selects the Add New Project option. The Add New Project screen appears. User fills in project information form and sends it for approval. Administrator is notified that a new project has been submitted for approval. Administrator reviews the project and makes a decision whether or not this project is suitable for the PRJ566 course. Once approved, the project is added to the company page and to the list of available projects for an appropriate semester. The company is notified by e-mail. </br>
</br>
Scenario 2: Sponsor is not registered. </br>
</br>
The company representative selects the registration option on the PRJ566 Home Page. The Legal Agreement Contract appears along with a FAQ site. Once the representative accepts the agreement, the company and project information form appears. User fills in the form, providing the company name, address, phone number, contact name, contact e-mail and project information, and sends it for approval. Administrator is notified that a new Sponsor has submitted a project registration for approval. Administrator reviews the project and makes a decision whether or not this project is suitable for the PRJ566 course. Once approved, a company account and a company page (generated from a template) are created. An e-mail with company credentials is sent to the provided e-mail address. </br>
</br>
Privacy and security of sponsor, team and project information must be protected.
